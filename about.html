            When I was six, I was 100% sure I wanted to be a librarian. I also wanted to be a professional horseback
            rider. And a teacher. And an astronaut. And a veterinarian, but only the part where the pets are happy. And
            also a firefighter. Six-year-old me was crushed when a teacher broke the news that I couldn't be a horseback
            riding librarian astronaut. (How rude, right?)
            <br><br>
            It turns out that I'm none of those things now.
            <br><br>
            But, for my entire life, I've loved computers and the multitude of things you can do with such comparatively
            small technology. I practically grew up on the computer-- here's photographic evidence!

            Anyway, thanks for checking out my site! I'm now a 21 year old college student living in Chapel Hill, NC. I
            have a passion for helping others and a passion for tech, so I hope to mix those passions together in my
            future career.
